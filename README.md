# Project: Visualizing Real World Data

## Overview

I made a research investigation about the COVID-19 in Mexico to find out if the government have been doing a right handle of the virus acording cases and deads.

Here you can find the original Data set link and the data cleaning file I used to plot.

The plots were made on Tableau:
